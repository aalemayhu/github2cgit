# github2cgit

Just something to help generate the information required by [cgit][0] to
display your repository.  Please remember to include the repository file in
your `/etc/cgitrc`.

Here is a real example:

    css=/cgit.css
    logo=/cgit.png
        virtual-root=/
        include=/etc/github_repositories
